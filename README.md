<h2> The main phases involved in database design </h2>
<strong>Conceptual database design</strong> – to build the conceptual representation of the database, which includes identification of the important entities, relationships, and attributes. <br>
<strong>Logical database design</strong> – to translate the conceptual representation to the logical structure of the database, which includes designing the relations. <br>
  <strong>Physical database design</strong> – to decide how the logical structure is to be physically implemented (as relations) in the target Database Management System (DBMS). <br>
